This whole process has been a painstaking process, as there was always problems with the gradle version amongst other things, however this is what I could get to work.

The motivation behind this project is I was studying with a friend and mentioned that I was creating an app. My friend had mentioned they had some friends over for some drinks, and someone had spilt their drink and ruined their flash cards. From this I thought it could be cool to make a flashcard app, where you can practice different subjects. Utilizing Open Trivia Database, a general pack of 50 different questions was provided, where the app utilizes 10 at random.
